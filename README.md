Microarray Data Analysis
=================================

# Introduction
Microarray technology has become one of the indispensable tools that many biologists use to monitor genome wide expression levels of genes in a given organism. A microarray is typically a glass slide on to which DNA molecules are fi xed in an orderly manner at specific locations called spots. A microarray may contain thousands of spots and each spot may contain a few million copies of identical DNA molecules that uniquely correspond
to a gene. The DNA in a spot may either be genomic DNA or short stretch of oligo-nucleotide strands that correspond to a gene. The spots are printed on to the glass slide by a robot or are synthesised by the process of photolithography.
Microarrays may be used to measure gene expression in many ways, but one of the most popular applications is to compare expression of a set of genes from a cell maintained in a particular condition (condition A) to the same set of genes from a reference cell maintained under normal conditions (condition B).

    <em>(A) A microarray may contain thousands of ʻspotsʼ. Each spot contains many copies of the same DNA sequence that uniquely represents a gene from an organism. Spots are arranged in an orderly fashion into Pen-groups. (B) Schematic of the experimental protocol to study differential expression of genes. The organism is grown in two different conditions (a reference condition and a test condition). RNA is extracted from the two cells, and is labelled with different dyes (red and green) during the synthesis of cDNA by reverse transcriptase. Following this step, cDNA is hybridized onto the microarray slide, where each cDNA molecule representing a gene will bind to the spot containing its complementary DNA sequence. The microarray slide is then excited with a laser at suitable wavelengths to detect the red and green dyes. The final image is stored as a file for further analysis.</em>
